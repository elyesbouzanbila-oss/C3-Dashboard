      the socket peer address (``$remote_addr``), overwriting anything the
      client sent, so it cannot be spoofed when traffic flows through the

      flag and route all traffic through nginx.
    - The socket peer address (``request.client.host``) for direct
      connections (dev / mock mode, or in-cluster pod traffic).

    ``X-Forwarded-For`` is deliberately ignored: it is append-only from the
    proxy's perspective, so when a client connects directly it controls
    every entry and can rotate it to reset the limiter (the classic
    brute-force bypass). Similarly, when TRUST_PROXY_HEADERS is disabled,
